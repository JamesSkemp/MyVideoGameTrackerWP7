Seeing as how I'll be moving to Android with my new phone (unless Google still hasn't released a phone that will work on my network), I'm releasing my Windows Phone 7 application, My Video Game Tracker, to the world.

The application is functional, it just isn't that pretty. And some people wanted more features than I needed in my particular case.
